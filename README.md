# MERN Stack CRUD Exam for Intern Student

Welcome to the **MERN Stack CRUD Exam!** This exam is designed to test your understanding and proficiency in building a full-stack web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The exam will assess your ability to create, read, update, and delete data from a database, as well as your knowledge of RESTful APIs, routing, and basic frontend development with React.js.

## Instructions

Please read the following instructions carefully before starting the exam:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Ensure that you have MongoDB, Node.js, and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
3.  Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.
4.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide the necessary environment variables (such as database connection URL, secret keys, etc.).
5.  Implement the required features described below.
6.  Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
7.  Send the link to your GitHub repository to the exam administrator.

## Exam Requirements

You are required to build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the MERN stack. The application should allow users to manage a collection of items. Each item should have a title, description, and a timestamp indicating when it was created.

The application should have the following features:

-   **Create**: Users should be able to add new items to the collection by providing a title and description.
-   **Read**: Users should be able to view a list of all items in the collection, displaying their titles, descriptions, and creation timestamps.
-   **Update**: Users should be able to edit the title and description of an existing item.
-   **Delete**: Users should be able to remove an item from the collection.

### Backend Requirements

-   Use Node.js and Express.js to build the backend server.
-   Use MongoDB as the database to store the items.
-   Implement RESTful API endpoints to handle the CRUD operations.
-   Implement data validation and error handling.
-   Use appropriate middleware for handling requests, such as body parsing, CORS, etc.
-  Don't Forget to add **.gitignore**

### Frontend Requirements

-   Use React.js to build the frontend interface.
-   Create a user-friendly UI to display the list of items, add new items, edit existing items, and delete items.
-   Implement form validation for the input fields.
-   Make asynchronous API requests to communicate with the backend server.
-   Handle and display any errors or success messages.

### Bonus Points (Optional)

If you would like to challenge yourself and earn bonus points, you can consider implementing the following additional features:

-   User authentication and authorization.
-   Pagination or infinite scrolling for the list of items.
-   Sorting or filtering options for the list of items.
-   Responsive design for optimal user experience on different devices.
-   Unit tests or integration tests to ensure the reliability of your code.
-   Deployment of the application to a hosting service, such as Heroku or AWS.

## Evaluation

Your exam solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   Correct implementation of the required features.
-   Code quality, organization, and adherence to best practices.
-   Proper error handling and validation.
-   User interface design and user experience.
-   Use of Git for version control, including meaningful commit messages.

Feel free to ask any questions if you need clarification on any aspect of the exam.

Good luck with your exam!
